# linear-regression
Linear Regression with different forms of Gradient Descent which includes stochastic gradient descent and mini batch gradient descent.

This code also uses two types of loss functions- Mean Squared Error Loss and Absolute Error loss. The comparisons are made without the different parameters.
The parameters are evaluated by the number of gradient updates and time taken to converge.
